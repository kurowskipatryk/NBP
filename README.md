# NBP

Hi

This project created for a recruitment task.  It is a service that communicates with the NBP API (http://api.nbp.pl/) in order to download the current exchange rates and enter them into the database. 
It is also used to draw a graph for various currencies.

The program is written in Blazor and the database in MSSQL.

To run the program you need to change the database server in the <strong> appsetting.json</strong> file and Update-Database Package Menager Console (Visual Studio).
